## HeroesOfPymoli 

### Assignment Description
>Analyze the data for an independent gaming company's most recent fantasy game *Heroes of Pymoli*.

>Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company has requested a generated report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

### Data Analysis Calculations
* Purchase analysis for all purchases
* Gender demographics (*male*, *female*, *other/non-diclased*)
* Purchase analysis based on gender demographics
* Age demographics (*<10*, *10-14*, *15-19*, *20-24*, *25-29*, *30-34*, *35-39*, *40+*)
* Purchase analysis based on age demographics
* Top spenders
* Most Popular items
* Most Profitable items

### Data Trends
1. The largest percentage of the purchases (*84%*) were completed by male players, but the average value of each purchase was smaller than those identifying as female/other/non-disclosed
1. The largest age demographic of the purchases was those falling into the 20 - 24 year age bin (*45%*), this age group was also in the top three for the average amount spent per person
1. The two most popular items are also the most profitable, *Final Critic* and *Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm*

note: I also attempted PyCitySchools, but my values in the last three sections do not match the given tables, so it is not part of my submission.
